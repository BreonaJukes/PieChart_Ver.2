# PieChart_Ver.2
This repository has the code of a pie chart that imports data from a file. Most of the code is the same but I left the activities and slices list empty. This time the data will be coming from a file. I used a for loop and an open statement to get the data from a txt file and then append these lists to the empty lists I already have.
